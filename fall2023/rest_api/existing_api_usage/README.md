## How use to an existing REST API

This code was used by participants to learn how to use an existing REST API hosted by a third party using HTTP requests made with Python's Requests library.

The first activity, in `fun_facts.py`, called to a useless random facts API as a simple example of how to make an HTTP request.

The second activity, in `weather.py`, called to OpenWeather's API to get the latitude and longitude of a zip code with one request, then a second call to get the weather at that location.

### Commands
1) Python's Requests library must be installed with `pip install requests` before it can be imported in a file

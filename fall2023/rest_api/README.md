## REST API Workshop
Occured on October 18, 2023

### About
Participants learned the basics of REST APIs including what they are, how to use existing REST APIs, and how to create your own.
During the workshop, attendees first learned the basic principles of REST APIs.
Then, they went through activities using a [random fact API](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/), and a [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The code for these activities can be found under `existing_api_usage/`.
Finally, they learned to create their own simple REST API using FastAPI. The code for this activity can be found under `create_your_own/`.

There are many free REST APIs available to use in projects of your own. [Here is a compiled list of them](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

Participants learned to use a variety of different electronic components that are commonly seen in circuits used in class, personal projects, and professional settings.
During the workshop, attendees split into stations and learned how to create a circuit and code an Arduino to use different components at each station.
This folder includes all of the circuits and code used in each station.

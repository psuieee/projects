# Penn State IEEE
## Electronic Component Workshop
Occured on September 27, 2023

### About
Participants learned to use a variety of different electronic components that are commonly seen in circuits used in class, personal projects, and professional settings.
During the workshop, attendees split into stations and learned how to create a circuit and code an Arduino to use different components at each station.
This folder includes all of the circuits and code used in each station.

#### Components taught:
* Input devices (button, potentiometer)
* Output devices (LED, RGB LED, buzzer)
* Ultrasonic sensor
* Accelerometer
* Servo motors
* Logic gates

### Purchasing components
Almost all of the components taught can be purchased in a single kit.

The [ELEGOO UNO Super Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4?keywords=Arduino+Components&qid=1694111872&sr=8-3) contains every component except for the accelerometers and logic gates. It includes the Arduino UNO, breadboard, jumper wires, and resistors as well.

Accelerometers are a more unique component which can be purchased seperately [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LP25V1A).

Logic gates can be purchased in a kit including the ones used in the workshop and more complex integrated circuits. The kit used during the workshop can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JTXNP9Q).

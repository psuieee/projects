# Logic Gate Station
This station taught participants about the basics of logic gates, including their truth tables and how to connect them individually.
It then showed off a more complex circuit using smaller logic gates to build a XOR gate.

## Materials required
* AND logic gate
* OR logic gate
* NOT logic gate
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires

# Accelerometer Station
This station described the physics that allow an accelerometer sensor to work. 
It also showed participants how to connect it to an Arduino and program it to measure the current angle.

## Materials required
* Accelerometer sensor
* Arduino (ESP32 board used in demonstration but not required)
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires
